"Hello World!"
I write, erase, rewrite
Erase again, and then
A poppy blooms.
overwrite

overwrite Kendell
old pond
frog leaps in
water's sound
haiku

haiku
Goes out,
comes back,
the love life of a cat.
Starry expanse bright
A silent choir of old light
Night cradles our dreams
Snowflakes softly land,  
Winterâ€™s hush embraces all,  
Solitude dawns bright.
"Goodbye world!!"
