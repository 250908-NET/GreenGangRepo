"Hello World!"
I write, erase, rewrite
Erase again, and then
A poppy blooms.
Screens glow in the night,
messages drift like soft rain,
silence still feels loud.
old pond
frog leaps in
water's sound

haiku
Goes out,
comes back,
the love life of a cat.
Starry expanse bright
A silent choir of old light
Night cradles our dreams
Snowflakes softly land,  
Winterâ€™s hush embraces all,  
Solitude dawns bright.
"Goodbye world!!"
